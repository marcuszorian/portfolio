## About Me

I’m a final-year Computer Science student with hands-on experience in networking and cybersecurity, developed through both my studies and professional roles. Currently, I work as a Gateway Engineering Cadet, maintaining high-availability gateways and security appliances that protect networks for Australian Government agencies.

Previously, I completed two Cyber Security internships, where I contributed to threat detection, security research and employee awareness training. These experiences have strengthened my technical ability and my commitment to further developing my skills in network security.

Outside of work and uni, I enjoy creating network security tools, practicing LeetCode and playing card games with my friends.

I’m currently looking for graduate opportunities in cybersecurity or network engineering. Please send me a message on LinkedIn if you are interested.
